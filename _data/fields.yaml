    "A Note on Sunday Pickup"
    "Due to the increasing schedule of IKU and Kuru practices, an 
     increasing schedule of tournaments, and increasing difficulties 
     in field availability, pickup has not been as regular recently 
     as it used to be. We encourage you to contact us or check on our 
     facebook page to confirm that pickup is on before coming out."

    "If you haven't been out to play before, Futako-Shinchi is the easier
     station to travel from without getting lost -- plus at times we play
     right by the station."
    
    "From Futako-Shinchi Station"

    "Exit out the north exit, and turn left to head towards the river. 
     You'll pass a few convenience stores where you can pick up water
     if you need it. Continue straight at a traffic light and you'll 
     eventually reach a road running parallel to the river. Cross this 
     street and look out at the baseball fields straight in front of 
     you -- if the fields here are free of baseballers we typically 
     play here, right at the station. If you don't see discs, however, 
     head down to the dirt path just before the baseball fields, turn 
     left, and continue heading away from the train tracks. You'll 
     eventually need to cross a bridge, and then keep walking. 
     Eventually you'll reach a new set of fields set back from the 
     road (if you've followed the dirt path the whole way, there'll be 
     a mini-golf course to your left and fields to your right). We'll 
     either be playing abeam to the mini-golf course or past it."

    "From Kuji Station"

    "Head out the (single set of) faregates and turn right. You'll 
     come to a intersection with a pedestrian crossover. Either use 
     the crossover or cross the street in both directions, then turn 
     left. Take the next Right (after the conbini) and head down the 
     side street to the second traffic light. Turn right here and 
     follow the street down to the river road (you'll see an emankment 
     and fields beyond it). Generally speaking we play to the right of 
     here; turn right and then head in at the first road on the left 
     (which will take you to the parking lot)."

    "NOTE: If we're playing at the baseball fields at Futako-Shinchi 
     station, you will have a very long walk from Kuji station. The 
     directions here take you to the Kuji Fields which are about 
     1.2 miles from Futako-Shinchi station. If you reach the Kuji 
     Fields and learn that we're at the Shinchi baseball fields, turn 
     right while facing the river (so the river is on your left) and 
     start walking... we'll be straight ahead just before you reach 
     the railroad bridge."
