  schedule: "Sunday practice & pickup, 2pm to dusk"
  schedule_details: 
    - >
      Due to the increasing schedule of IKU and Kuru practices, more 
      tournaments, and less field availability, pickup has not been as 
      regular as it used to be.
    - > 
      Please check our facebook page to confirm that pickup is on 
      before coming out.

          From Futako-Shinchi Station (Denentoshi Line), it's up to a 1.2 mile walk.
          (Red path)

          From Kuji Station (JR Nambu Line), it's a 0.8 mile walk. (Blue path)

  directions: >
    It's easier to get to the fields from Futako-Shinchi station. 
    Also, at times we play right by the station.<br><br>
    
    From Futako-Shinchi Station<br><br>

    Exit out the north gate, and turn left. Continue straight until you 
    hit a wall. Turn left and go up the stairs to the crosswalk. Cross.
    If the baseball fields are free, sometimes we play right there.
    Otherwise, walk down to the dirt path, and turn left. Cross the bridge.
    Eventually you will reach a minigolf course. To the right of them 
    there will be fields. Should take about 20 minutes.<br><br>

    From Kuji Station<br><br>

    Exit the station and turn right. You'll come to a intersection with 
    a pedestrian crossover. Either use the crossover or cross the street 
    in both directions, then turn left. Take the next right (after the 
    conbini) and head down the side street to the second traffic light. 
    Turn right here and follow the street down to the river road (you'll 
    see an embankment and fields beyond it). We usually play to the right 
    of here. Turn right and then head in at the first road on the left, 
    which will take you to the parking lot.<br>

    If we're playing at the baseball fields at Futako-Shinchi station, 
    you will have a very long walk from Kuji station. To get to the 
    Futako-Shinchi baseball fields from Kuji fields, turn right while 
    facing the river (so the river is on your left) and start walking. 
    The baseball fields are just before you reach the railroad bridge.<br><br>
  equipment: Cleats. Disc. Light & dark shirts for pickup.
