</figure></a></p><h1>Shrine at the <a href="https://www.hotel-grandmer.com">Hotel Grand Mer Sankaiso</a></h1><p>Context: Road trip up to Aomori to stay in a cabin and watch the snow fall.</p><p>After marinating in the cabin for a few days we decided to go to an onsen and marinate in some nice hot water for a change. The incredibly patient K (the only person with a license out of our group of six, despite the fact that we were going on a <em>road trip</em>) drove us over to a nearby onsen hotel with a view overlooking the ocean.</p><p>It was incredibly windy, to the point where the people at the hotel informed us that we wouldn't be able to use the outdoor baths. Fortunately that turned out to be more of a suggestion than a prohibition, which everyone ignored.</p><p>One excellent thing about expensive hotels in Japan is that they generally also sell access to their onsen for less than ¬•1000. I wonder if it's a loss leader, and they expect to make it up in people sticking around for their restaurant or gift shops. Or even for an onsen customer to come back sometime for a hotel stay.</p><p>The wind really was howling outside. But there was a peculiar joy to staring out into the dark, hearing the roar of the ocean and the howl of the wind, shifting in and out of the hot water to adjust from one extreme temperature to the next.</p><p>Anyway, after the bath, I had a few moments to explore the hotel lobby and I noticed this small shrine outside. Since it was the new year, it seemed like a good opportunity for <em>hatsumoude</em>.</p><p>Under the ocean's roar, I whispered my wishes for 2020. What I wished for, I couldn't tell you now - my memory has been washed away by the sound of those waves.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-25-sotd</guid><title>Tochoji</title><description>On the way to work, April 29, 2020</description><link>https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-25-sotd</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 22:42:00 +0900</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="./../../sotd/tochoji-graveyard.jpeg"><figure>

</figure></a></p><h1><a href="https://www.tochoji.jp">Tochoji</a></h1><p>I needed to pick something up from the office. I think this was the first time I had been to the office in a month? Two? And I haven't been back since.</p><p>This temple has always caught my eye, because it seems so modern. One of the nice things about this project is that it's really gotten me to slow down and have a proper look at some of the things I'm passing by. I don't have the patience to walk everywhere a l√° <a href="https://craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a>, but I've paused along my usual routes and finally poked my head into some of the interesting places along the way.</p><p>The temple is actually more modern than I thought. There is a weird tower across the street, which I would not have imagined was related. But apparently it's a meditation hall. I don't even have a picture of it, because I had no idea there was a connection.</p><p>I love walking through graveyards. On a windy day the wooden markers (<em>sotoba</em>) clack and rattle against each other. Aoyama-reien is a favorite of mine. There's always another corner to explore there. I think the connection I feel to graveyards here is because the rituals of care, of cleaning, decorating, and communing, feel so close to the rituals of care for the graves of my mother's family.</p><p>When I first moved to Japan, I would occasionally take a shortcut through a temple graveyard to shave a minute off of my fifteen-minute walk to work. It was my first summer here and I had to wear a suit every day. I didn't have any light suits, nor did I even really understand that there was such a thing as different suits for different seasons. I say this to try, and fail, to justify my reasons for shaving as much time off my walk as I could. Anyway, one day an elderly woman was there, taking care of her family grave, and she gave me The Look of Death, specifically the What The Hell Do You Think You're Doing Here You Damn Dirty Foreigner, and in this case she was absolutely right. That was enough to keep me from using that shortcut ever again.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-24-sotd</guid><title>Mizuinari-jinja</title><description>After beer trading, May 2, 2020</description><link>https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-24-sotd</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 10:22:00 +0900</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="./../../sotd/mizuinari-jinja-lantern.jpeg"><figure>

(Circa 941 üò±)</p><p>It used to be somewhere which is now the Waseda campus. (It's now across the street from it.)</p><p>I was imagining that Waseda had some connection to the shrine, because Waseda (Êó©Á®≤Áî∞) contains one of the same kanji as inari (Á®≤Ëç∑). Long story short, no, not beyond the fact that both things are related to the harvest, like just about everything else. Waseda used to be the cow place, next to the high horse place, but then it got renamed to the early rice place. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p><a href="https://kyotobrewing.com/">Kyoto Brewing Company is delivering six-packs of good craft beer for reasonable prices.</a> By "reasonable prices," I mean that it's cheaper than buying craft beer at a bar, if going to a bar and purchasing a craft beer was actually a thing you could do. Their selection seems to be changing quite frequently, which is great if what you like is variety. Since I like variety, I negotiated a trade with a co-worker who had bought a different six-pack. A couple of my Êò•„ÅÆÊ∞ó„Åæ„Åê„Çå (a pale ale) for a couple of his Â§úÁ©∫„ÇíËóçÊüì„ÇÅ (a berry sour).</p><p><a href="./../../sotd/mizuinari-jinja.jpeg"><figure>

  <figcaption>The guardians are not impressed by your "what does the fox say?" joke. They've already heard it a million times.</figcaption>
</figure></a></p><p>We attempted to conduct the trade in a socially distanced manner. We handed the beers off, one by one, in order to stay at arms' length, awkwardly stretching our hands as far away from our vulnerable orifices as we could. Now that I think about it, we could have set the beers on the ground in a neutral zone and then retrieved the beers. Like we were trying to set up some exchange in which neither could double-cross the other and try and grab all the goods for themselves.</p><p>It's been a few weeks since the trade and neither of us is dead. We can employ more advanced strategies next time, I guess.</p><p>On the way back from this exchange, I stopped by this shrine, which I had never bothered to investigate when I was at Waseda. Fox (inari) shrines tend to be just a small altar off to the side of another, larger shrine, so I like seeing them stand on their own.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-17-sotd</guid><title>Sousenji</title><description>On the way home from the Arakawa, May 16, 2020</description><link>https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/blog/2020-05-17-sotd</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 08:29:00 +0900</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="./../../sotd/sousenji-hill.jpeg"><figure>

</figure></a></p><h1>Tofukuji</h1><p>I had a great plan to start work early in order to take a two-hour lunch break to get some solo throwing and agility training in. The previous weekend I had discovered that Heiwanomori park now has a turf multi-use field that is open to the public, with a few nets that I could throw into. Unfortunately, now that the state of emergency was in effect, that field was closed. They used to have a big grass field, but it's under renovation.</p><p>Frustrated and pressed for time, I found another park on the map and headed up to it in hopes of at least having some space to do my agility workout.</p><p>On the way, I passed by a couple of temples, of which this is one. I would have loved to explore a bit more, but I just took one shot of this gentleman walking in and moved on.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/projects/why</guid><title>Why</title><description>What's this site for?</description><link>https://weissazool.github.io/weissazool/projects/why</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 15:07:00 +0900</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Why</h1><p>Why does this site exist?</p><h2>Learning</h2><p>I used to play around with Jekyll to generate static sites from Markdown. I probably have a few public repositories of these here and there.</p><p>Unfortunately, it felt hard to justify time and effort working with Jekyll, since it was so different from what I did on a day-to-day basis. Although I must note that learning a templating tool (Liquid) has come in handy when using <a href="https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen">SwiftGen</a>. At any rate, generating static sites from Swift will allow me to play with something that is more relevant to what I want to be doing work-wise, so, two birds with one stone.</p><h2>Fun</h2><p>I miss writing!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
