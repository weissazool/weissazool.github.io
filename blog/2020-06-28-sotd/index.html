I don't know how many dozens of times I've passed on it before even noticing it, much less actually taken the time to stop and have a look. It almost feels like someone's cottage hidden at the back of a garden path, which is... unusual, to say the least, for Shinjuku. The hortensias must be in bloom right now. I should stop by again.</p><p>Speaking of flowering plants, I picked up an app that you can use to take a photo of a flower - and then it identifies the plant for you.</p><p>First of all, that's amazing, technologically, partly because at this point it's <em>not</em> amazing anymore. We are beginning to take for granted that there will be some service or app that can identify things for you based on images. A friend and I were trying to figure out what some flowers were as we were walking around Ueno park, and I thought, gee, I wonder if there's an app for that? Yes, yes there is. (I tried PictureThis.)</p><p>More importantly, I recognized most of the names of the flowers we saw. But I had never been able to associate an image with that name. I hope I will remember and have clearer images of a scene in my mind when someone writes about dogwoods or mallow in novels. I feel like people have practically no botanical knowledge with which to frame their imagination when reading them as words in a book. Coincidentally, I'm reading a book called Overstory with some friends, in which plants play a major role, so... the timing is good.</p><p><a href="./../../sotd/lantana.jpeg"><figure>

  <figcaption>The thing is, I don't remember seeing any of these on Lantana Road...</figcaption>
</figure></a></p><p>Just yesterday, I was walking around Daikanyama and used the app to identify a flower. Turns out they're called "lantana." Which is the name of a road near where I lived as a child. I never stopped to think about where that road's name came from before - it was just simply the name of the road. So, turns out it's a plant. Native to the southeast US, so I don't know what the hell it's doing here. I'd be pleased to feel the little touch of home, especially since it's not like I can go there right now, only, well, it's an invasive species. So it goes.</p><p>Oh, and following up on Kinoene soy sauce. I couldn't find any in the supermarket. Maybe it's not actually a thing?</p></div><p>Published Jun 28, 2020</p><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/sotd">SOTD</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
